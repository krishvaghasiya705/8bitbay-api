For the first time with three-years of development, the revered, award-winning studio has created its first title for next-gen hardware in the critically acclaimed Black Ops series. Welcome to Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, a dark, twisted future where a new breed of Black Ops soldier emerges and the lines are blurred between our own humanity and the technology we created to stay ahead, in a world where cutting-edge military robotics define warfare. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 combines three unique game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies, providing fans with the deepest and most ambitious Call of Duty ever. The Campaign has been designed as a co-op game that can be played with up to 4 players online or as a solo cinematic thrill-ride. Multiplayer will be the franchise‚Äôs deepest, most rewarding and most engaging to date, with new ways to rank up, customize, and gear up for battle. And Zombies delivers an all-new mind-blowing experience with its own dedicated narrative. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 can be played entirely online, and for the first time each of the offerings has its own unique player XP and progression systems. The title ushers in an unprecedented level of innovation, including jaw-dropping environments, never before experienced weaponry and abilities, and the introduction of a new, improved fluid movement system. All of this is brought to life by advanced technology custom crafted for this title, including new AI and animation systems, and graphics that redefine the standards Call of Duty fans have come to expect from the critically-acclaimed series, with cutting edge lighting systems and visual effects.",

        "description": "The second game of the FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE trilogy. After escaping Midgar, the City of Mako, Cloud and his friends overcome the boundaries of fate and step into the unknown wasteland. A vast world with many characteristics awaits, as well as a new story where you will run through fields on chocobos to freely explore points of interest. The lifestream forms the very cycle of existence, with all life born from the planet and all returning to its embrace. However, the sinister Shinra Electric Power Company extracts this vital life energy, spending it liberally as a fuel source called ‚Äúmako‚Äù. After a ferocious battle, Ex-SOLDIER Cloud Strife and his companions Tifa, Aerith, Barret and Red XIII escape the mako-powered city of Midgar to step out into the wide world. A journey across the planet begins ‚Äì riding Chocobos across vast and trackless plains, visiting many familiar places in pursuit of the fallen hero Sephiroth, and the chase culminating in the party‚Äôs journey to ‚ÄúThe Forgotten Capital‚Äù from the original FINAL FANTASY VII. At the same time, SOLDIER 1st class Zack Fair drags his battered body across the wastelands leading into Midgar, supporting his dear friend who is delirious from severe mako poisoning. Beyond the boundary between life and death, he sees an ominous rift spreading across the heavens. The Shinra Resistance Committee, a rising power led by the acting government of Wutai, declares war. A group of mysterious figures veiled in dark black cloaks carry the remains of Jenova, the ‚ÄúCalamity from the Sky‚Äù, to ends unknown. Sensing the planet‚Äôs encroaching crisis, the ancient guardians known as Weapons begin to awaken within the lifestream itself. All while the machinations of Cloud‚Äôs sworn enemy, Sephiroth, cause countless fates to collide and entwine, and lo, destiny itself will be reborn again. The FINAL FANTASY VII remake trilogy ‚Äì The FINAL FANTASY VII remake project uses the latest technology to bring FINAL FANTASY VII, the legendary RPG that enchanted the world, to a new generation and allows fans to experience the famed story reimagined. The first game in the trilogy, FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE, was released in 2020, achieving critical acclaim across the globe and shipping more than seven million units worldwide. Now, the second game, FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH, returns to tell the story at the core of the trilogy and has already achieved critical acclaim.",
