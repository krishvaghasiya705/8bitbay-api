Kratos and Atreus must journey to each of the Nine Realms in search of answers as Odin’s forces in Asgard prepare for a prophesied battle that will end the world.\n\nAlong the way, they will explore stunning, mythical landscapes, and face fearsome enemies in the form of Norse gods and monsters. As the threat of Ragnarök grows ever closer, Kratos and Atreus must choose between the safety of their family and the safety of the realms.\n\nA FUTURE, UNWRITTEN\nAtreus seeks knowledge to help him understand the prophecy of “Loki” and establish his role in Ragnarök. Kratos must decide whether he will be chained by the fear of repeating his mistakes or break free of his past to be the father Atreus needs.\n\nFLUID, EXPRESSIVE COMBAT\nThe Leviathan Axe, Blades of Chaos, and Guardian Shield return alongside a host of new abilities for both Kratos and Atreus. Kratos’ deadly Spartan skills will be tested like never before as he battles gods and monsters across Nine Realms to protect his family.\n\nEXPLORE VAST REALMS\nJourney through dangerous and stunning landscapes as Kratos and Atreus search for answers.\n\nMASTER THYSELF IN GOD OF WAR RAGNARÖK: VALHALLA\nAvailable right at launch with your purchase of God of War Ragnarök is access to the God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla DLC for no additional cost!\n\nAccompanied only by Mimir, Kratos embarks on a deeply personal and reflective journey that pushes him to master mind and body as he is confronted with the challenges of Valhalla in an unravelling, replayable adventure that blends the beloved combat from God of War Ragnarök with brand new elements inspired by the roguelite genre.\n\nAN EPILOGUE TO RAGNARÖK\nKratos’ journey continues as he enters Valhalla, a new location in the God of War Norse saga.
